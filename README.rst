M+	Motor Terminal 1	Motor Output
M-	Motor Terminal 2	Motor Output
B+	Battery Positive (12V or 24V)	Motor Power
B-	Battery Ground	Motor Power
 Functionality:

RPWM and LPWM are controlled using PWM signals to adjust speed and direction.
R_EN and L_EN must be set HIGH to enable movement.
BTS7960 provides high-power motor control (supports up to 43A).
